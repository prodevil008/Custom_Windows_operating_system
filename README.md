# Custom_Windows_operating_system
A "custom Windows operating system" is the ability to modify the standard OS to improve performance, change the interface, or add specific features. Unlike regular versions, customization allows you to customize the system more deeply for personal needs, for example, to increase performance, change the appearance or remove unnecessary components.
